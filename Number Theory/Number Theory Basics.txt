Important Points : 

1) Divisor count of a number = first we will break the number into its prime factorization
   for example : n=p^a * q^b * r^c than divisor count=(a+1)*(b+1)*(c+1)
   12=2^2*3^1;divisor count=(2+1)*(1+1)=6

2) A number which has exactly two divisor = prime number

3) numbers that has exactly three divisor = p^2(p means a prime number),(that means if someone asked you to find the numbers that has exactly 3 divisor upto N then you will use a loop up to N and find every prime and check whether it's square is less than N or not.)

4) numbers that has exactly Four divisor = p^3,p^1*q^1;

5) Higest divisor count of a number upto N will be cube root of N;(for example higest divisor of 10^9 is approximately 3sqrt(n)=1000) 

6) sum of all divisor of a number from prime factorization = suppose a number n = p^a * q^b * r^c----
   then sum of all divisor will be = ((p^(a+1))-1/p-1)*((q^(b+1)-1)/q-1)*((r^(c+1)-1)/r-1)----

7) The maximum Gap between two prime is log(n)^2.suppose n=1e^9 then the next prime from n can be found approximately after log(1e9)^2=900

8) by default __gcd function of compiler time complexity is log(n) so we will use this for finding gcd of two number

9) lcm = (a * b) / gcd;

10) Common multiple of two number a and b are the multiple of their lcm.

11) Common divisor of two number a and b are the divisor of their gcd.

12) (a+b),(a-b) is divisible by the gcd of a,b 

13) Every two consecutive numbers are coprime

14) if their is a grid of n,m length then the maximum square length that cover the whole grid will be gcd(n,m)

15) trailing zeros of a number n=2^a * 5^b *....... will be min(a,b).for example
    145000=2^3 * 5^4 * 29^1(prime factorization) then trailing zeros =min(3,4)=3;
   
16) a^p % mod == (a-mod)^p % mod;
17) Fermat's Little Theorem, a^(p-1) % p = 1;
